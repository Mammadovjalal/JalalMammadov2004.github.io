        <p class="ppp">At ADA University, our team embarked on an exciting web development project, creating a dynamic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our journey began with comprehensive learning on Codecademy, where we honed our coding skills and gained a solid understanding of these essential web technologies.

            Our website consists of four carefully crafted pages, each serving a distinct purpose. The Home page proudly showcases our team name, setting the tone for an engaging online experience. Navigating to the Members page, visitors can delve into detailed information about each team member, fostering transparency and connection.
            
            The Hour of Code project page is a highlight, featuring captivating images and a comprehensive report on our coding endeavors. This section not only showcases our technical prowess but also provides insight into our collaborative and innovative approach to problem-solving.
            
            The final page delves into the intricacies of the entire project, offering a reflective overview of the website's development process. From inception to execution, we share insights into the challenges faced and the triumphs achieved, providing visitors with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of our ADA University web project.</p>
